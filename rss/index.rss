&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/cancellation.png" alt="Churn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was devastated when I read it. Sure, it always sucks to lose a customer. But there are a few reasons why this one particularly stung:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was the first customer I ever actually sold Appcues to, so I had an emotional tie to them.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our champion at the company (the one who sent this email) was providing outstanding feedback on our product. We skyped with him often.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They epitomized the problem that we're trying to solve by building Appcues. They want to improve user engagement and conversion, and are constrained by the size of their development team.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were actually using the platform. It wasn't as if they signed up and never really got started. They had used Appcues to create in-app experience seen by tens of thousands of users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id="goodchurnvsbadchurn"&gt;Good churn vs. bad churn&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This email didn't actually come as a surprise. In December, our champion reached out to me to say they were looking into using one of our competitors. So we immediately set up a call to find out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talked to them, it was clear: &lt;strong&gt;they weren't successful with Appcues&lt;/strong&gt;. We had a half dozen things on our roadmap, but not yet in our product, that this customer really needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churn is never a "good" thing. But there's certainly some churn that's better than other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there is always going to be churn that is beyond your control: a customer goes out of business, or gets bought, or shifts their strategy and no longer needs you. That's "good" churn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's the okay churn: a customer cannot afford your product anymore, or the internal champion leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, there's bad churn: when a customer leaves because your product doesn't help them achieve their &lt;a href="http://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-desired-outcome"&gt;desired outcome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;strong&gt;bad churn&lt;/strong&gt;. And that's why losing this customer hurt so much. &lt;em&gt;We failed them.&lt;/em&gt; In fact, had we not built such a good relationship, this customer likely would've churned months prior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="gettingfeedbackattheexit"&gt;Getting feedback at the exit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons early stage startups fail is they build something that nobody wants. That's why it's so important to collect feedback from customers and potential customers all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there is no better opportunity for authentic feedback than when a customer leaves you. So when this customer left, we found out exactly why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've spoken to the customer a couple times since cancelling their subscription, and have learned quite a bit. We discovered &lt;del&gt;deficiencies&lt;/del&gt; opportunities for improvement in our product. We learned more about their desired outcome, and what we'd need to change to help them reach it. We heard how they thought we were different than our competitor, and what they really liked about their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's often said, "let customers vote with their wallets." Ours just did, but just because it wasn't the vote we wanted didn't mean that we could pass up the opportunity to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="howwelearnfromchurn"&gt;How we learn from churn&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to survive as an early stage startup, you must sell your vision, not your current capabilities. We often talk to prospective customers about features that don't exist yet, and investors about growth that hasn't happened yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, our customer lost the patience to wait for our vision to manifest. They needed capabilities today. And for that, I don't blame them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see this as a failure. But rather, I see it as an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to have &lt;em&gt;zero bad churn&lt;/em&gt;: zero customers leaving because they aren't reaching their desired outcomes. By studying our churn early on, we can better understand it and avoid it later on down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the gap between our current capabilities and our vision shrinks, so too will the gap between our capabilities and our customer's expectations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every successful startup had assumptions they needed to change, pivots they had to make. And there's no better catalyst for change than having someone tell you they don't want to give you money anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucks to no longer receive their revenue. But, in a sense, we've traded it for awareness and empathy. And this trade will (hopefully) allow us to close our gaps quicker, and build a better solution for our customers over the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churn won't always be an opportunity. But for now it is. And we intend to seize it. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/we-lost-a-customer/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">96aafa63-edf2-4818-872c-af9b88dabc0d</guid><dc:creator>Jackson Noel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2015 22:25:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Writing</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been a citizen of the internet for almost as long as I can remember, and generally like to consider myself an early adopter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not once did I hop on the blogging train. No blogger, tumblr, wordpress: none of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at this ripe age of 29, I've finally done it. I'm committing myself to writing, and this is my first ever (personal) blog post. So as my first post, I thought it'd only be fitting to reflect on why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I haven't done this yet, what's changed that makes me want to commit to writing, and what I hope to gain from doing so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="whyhaveinotdonethisyet"&gt;Why have I not done this yet?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never considered myself a particularly strong writer. Don't get me wrong, I've been proud of my writing at times. But it has never really come naturally to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not one of those students who could crank out a beautifully crafted paper in 90 minutes. It always took me longer to get to the quality level with which I was satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's reason number one: Writing is hard (for me). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason number two is different. &lt;em&gt;What do I have to say that people would actually want to read?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, I thought I had nothing unique to contribute. My areas of passion are already crowded with thought leaders. And I already love reading their work. So I couldn't imagine how I could meaningfully contribute to any audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="sowhathaschanged"&gt;So what has changed?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I met one of the scrappiest, most clever people I know. We were having coffee and towards the end of our conversation he asked me if I blogged. I said no and sort of shrugged it off. But then he replied, "you really should. I do and everything I'm passionate about is up there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those words really stuck with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This person, of course, was &lt;a href="http://jonathan-kim.com/"&gt;Jonathan Kim&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, he was working on a startup by himself called Appcues. A couple of months later, I was fortunate enough to join him as his co-founder (I'll save that story for another post). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jonathan and I started to work together, I took over our &lt;a href="http://appcues.com/academy/"&gt;User Onboarding Academy&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of long form lessons on the best practices of user onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my hesitations about writing, I was eager about working on the academy. After all, the goal was to use content to draw more visitors to the site, turn a small percentage of those visitors into customers, and help us grow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So writing = &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the academy hasn't only helped the company grow. It helped me grow. And it gave me a renewed appreciation for writing that goes beyond any extrinsic motivations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="writinghasallowedmetodevelopexpertise"&gt;Writing has allowed me to develop expertise&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of reading material on the internet. So in order for our academy to actually get visitors, we'd have to create thoughtful, compelling and original content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were two problems with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I thought I sucked at writing  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't know that much about onboarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, most of my career had been in finance and I only had one year of experience working at a software startup. While I had done some work on user onboarding before, I was by no means an expert. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in order to write quality academy lessons, I first had to learn. I did extensive research on user experience, behavioral psychology, data analytics, you name it. For many of the posts, this meant spending 20-30 hours researching (reading, talking to experts, etc.) before writing a single word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="writinghashelpedmehelpothers"&gt;Writing has helped me help others&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do I have to say that people would actually want to read?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing consistently for Appcues for six months, I have every reason to chalk up this old hesitation of mine as delusional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that time, the User Onboarding Academy has gained tens of thousands of readers and 2,000+ email subscribers. But more importantly than the stats, are the folks who reach out to ask a question or just to say thanks. They always make me smile :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="sowhatsthisblogallabout"&gt;So what's this blog all about?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing process has forced me to become a better thinker. A better learner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by doing so, it's allowed me to help others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these came as a pleasant surprise to me. So I'm starting this blog is to build off of that momentum. Hopefully it will continue to help me grow personally and professionally. And hopefully others will find it worthy of a read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learn more and as my experience with Appcues evolves, this is where I'll come to share. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/writing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">f2050018-d9ec-4a82-941e-c3f3ba2588a5</guid><dc:creator>Jackson Noel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2015 22:02:29 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
